## Data Cleansing

<div align="center"><img src="https://github.com/Vanz92x/Netflix-Userbase-Insight/assets/165736197/5f55a673-c56b-438a-86a9-6ee23f4448b1" /></div>

The table above shows that there are no missing values, but the Join Date and Last Payment Date columns have incorrect data types. Therefore, we need to change their data types to datetime to ensure accuracy and ease of data processing. This will allow us to calculate time intervals more accurately and sort the data by date.
